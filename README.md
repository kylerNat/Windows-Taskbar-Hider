A tiny utility program that keeps the taskbar hidden until it is activated with the windows key.

Tested with in Windows 10.

To use turn on "Automatically hide the taskbar in desktop mode" under the Windows Taskbar settings.

Then download and run the exe [here](https://github.com/kylerNat/Windows-Taskbar-Hider/raw/master/build/Taskbar%20Hider.exe)

To have the program run on startup place the exe inside: %AppData%\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup
